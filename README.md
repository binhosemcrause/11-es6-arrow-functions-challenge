## Description
An arrow function in JavaScript is a concise way to write functions, introduced in ES6. It uses the => syntax and allows for shorter function definitions. Arrow functions also automatically bind the value of this from their surrounding context, making them particularly useful in callbacks and methods. Here's a basic example:

```
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

This simplifies the traditional function expression and is often preferred for brevity and cleaner code.
